Platformer RPG game in unity (C#)

It's a Platformer with a story where you’re defeating enemies and collecting their weapons.
The game’s purpose is simply to go through all the levels and unlock a happy or sad ending.

Enemies have simple AI but I’m planning on upgrading it soon and adding some more variation.
There is leveling system and a possibility to play with different weapons.


This project is not finished yet and I’ll update it soon.

It is inspired by Shaun Spalding tutorials:
